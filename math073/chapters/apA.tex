\appendix\chapter{The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra}

Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix and let $T : V \to V$ be a linear transformation whose matrix $[T]_{\mathcal{C} \from \mathcal{B}}$ with respect to bases $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$ and $W$, respectively, is $A$.
The following statements are equivalent: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]	
	\item $A$ is invertible.
	\item $A\mbf{x} = \mbf{b}$ has a unique solution for every $\mbf{b} \in \R^n$.
	\item $A\mbf{x} = \mbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution.
	\item The reduced row echelon form of $A$ is $I_n$.
	\item $A$ is a product of elementary matrices.
	\item $\pfn{rank}(A) = n$
	\item $\pfn{nullity}(A) = 0$
	\item The column vectors of $A$ are linearly independent.
	\item The column vectors of $A$ span $\R^n$.
	\item The column vectors of $A$ form a basis for $\R^n$.
	\item The row vectors of $A$ are linearly independent.
	\item The row vectors of $A$ span $\R^n$.
	\item The row vectors of $A$ form a basis for $\R^n$.
	\item $\det A \neq 0$
	\item 0 is not an eigenvalue of $A$.
	\item $T$ is invertible.
	\item $T$ is one-to-one.
	\item $T$ is onto.
	\item $\pfn{ker}(T) = \{\mbf{0}\}$.
	\item $\pfn{range}(T) = W$.
	\item 0 is not a singular value of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
