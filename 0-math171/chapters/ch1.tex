\section{Basic Axioms and Properties}
For most of this course, the central object of study will be the group.

\begin{definition}[Binary operation]
    A binary operation on a set $G$ is a function $\star : G \times G \to G$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $a \star (b \star c) = (a \star b) \star c$ for all $a,b,c \in G$, then we say $\star$ is associative.
        \item If $a \star b = b \star a$ for all $a,b \in G$, then we say $\star$ is commutative.
    \end{itemize}
    For $a,b \in G$ we'll typically write $a \star b$ for $\star (a,b)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Group]
    A group is an ordered pair $(G, \star)$ where $G$ is a set and $\star$ is a binary operation on $G$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\star$ is associative,
        \item there exists an $e \in G$, called an identity, such that $a \star e = e \star a = a$ for all $a \in G$, and
        \item for each $a \in G$ there is an $a^{-1} \in G$, called an inverse of $a$, such that $a \star a^{-1} = a^{-1} \star a = e$.
    \end{itemize}
    We say the group $(G, \star)$ is commutative (or abelian) if $\star$ is commutative.
\end{definition}

We've already encountered many groups in our previous studies!
For example, under addition we have $\Z$, $\Q$, $\R$, $\C$, and $\Z / n\Z$ (the integers modulo $n$), and under multiplication we have $\Q^\times$, $\R^\times$, $\C^\times$, and $Z / n\Z^\times$ (where the $\times$ denotes zero-exclusion).
These examples help make the following properties a bit more concrete.

\begin{theorem}[]       % TODO: fix a_1^{-1} and a_2^{-1}
    If $(G, \star)$ is a group then
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item the identity of $G$ is unique,
        \item $a^{-1}$ is unique for each $a \in G$,
        \item $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$,
        \item $(a \star b)^{-1} = b^{-1} \star a^{-1}$, and
        \item for all $a_1, \cdots, a_n \in G$, the value of $a_1 \star \cdots \star a_n$is independent of how the expression is bracketed.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove the first two parts.
    
    (a) Suppose $e$ and $e'$ are both identities.
    Then we have the chain of equalities
    \[ e = e \star e' = e'. \]

    (b) Suppose some $a \in G$ has two inverses $a', a''$.
    Then we have the chain of equalities
    \[ a' = a' \star e = a' \star (a \star a'') = (a' \star a) \star a'' = a''. \]

    Other parts are left as exercises.
\end{proof}

With these properties in mind, we'll make a few notes on notation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We read $(G, \star)$ aloud as ``G is a group under $\star$''.
    In practice, if the binary operation is self-evident, we'll simply write $G$ to mean $(G, \star)$.

    \item For a group $(G, \star)$ we'll usually write $ab$ to mean $a \star b$.
    In the same spirit, we can write a length-$n$ product $x \star \cdots \star x$ as $x^{n}$, and $x^{-n} = \left( x^{-1} \right)^{n}$.
    (This is called multiplicative notation.)

    \item When multiplicative notation is being used, we will usually denote the identity of $G$ by 1 and set $x^{0} = 1$.
\end{itemize}
We'll finish off here with a few definitions which will be useful in future discussions.

\begin{definition}[Order of an element]
    Let $G$ be a group and let $x \in G$.
    The order $|x|$ of $x$ is the smallest $n \in \Z^+$ such that $x^{n} = 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Generator]
    Let $G$ be a group, and let $S$ be a subset of $G$.
    We say that $S$ generates $G$ if every element of $G$ can be written as a finite product of elements in $S$ and their inverses.

    In this case, $S$ is a set of generators for $G$ and we write $G \left< S \right>$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Presentation]
    Let $G$ be a group that is generated by $S$ with a set of relations $R$.
    $G$ has presentation $\left< S \,|\, R \right>$.
\end{definition}

\section{Some Important Groups}
Now we'll look at a few different kinds of well-known groups.

\begin{definition}[Dihedral group]
    The dihedral group of order $2n$ is the group $D_{2n}$ of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon.
\end{definition}

In general we'll use $r \in D_{2n}$ to denote clockwise rotation by $2\pi / n$ and $s \in D_{2n}$ for reflection through a fixed line of symmetry.
We can get a few nice results from this!
\begin{itemize}
    \item $D_{2n} = \left\{ 1, \, r, \, r^2, \, \ldots, \, r^{n-1} \right\} \cup \left\{ s, \, sr, \, sr^2, \, \ldots, \, sr^{n-1} \right\}$ (where the two sets are disjoint).
    \item $|r| = n$ and $|s| = 2$.
    \item $r^{i} s = s r^{-i}$ for all $i \in \Z$.
\end{itemize}
Thinking of the elements of $D_{2n}$ as physical transformations is useful.
But they're perhaps better understood as \textit{equivalence classes} of physical moves since, for example, $r^{n}$ is equivalent to $r^{2n}$.

\begin{definition}[Symmetric group]
    Let $\Omega$ be a non-empty set, and let $S_\Omega$ be the set of all bijections from $\Omega$ to $\Omega$.
    The set $S_\Omega$ forms a group under function composition, and it is called the symmetric group on $\Omega$.
\end{definition}

Note that if $\Omega = \left\{ 1, \, 2, \, \ldots, \, n \right\}$ then we write $S_\Omega = S_n$.
Permutations on such $\Omega$ can be communicated in several different ways---for example, if we had the bijection
\[ 1 \mapsto 3 \qquad 2 \mapsto 5 \qquad 3 \mapsto 1 \qquad 4 \mapsto 2 \qquad 5 \mapsto 4, \]
then we have the two-line, one-line, and cycle notations, respectively:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 3 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad (1 \; 3)(2 \; 5 \; 4). \]

% s = (1 3)(2 5 4)
% t = (1 4)(2 3)

% tst^-1 = ( t(1) t(3) )( t(2) t(5) t(4) )
% this is a conjugation of s by t.
% same idea as similar matrices. same transformation, different coordinates!

We again have a few important facts about symmetric groups.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The order of $S_n$ is $n!$ ($|S_n| = n!$).
    \item $S_n$ is non-abelian for $n \geq 3$.
    \item Disjoint cycles commute.
    \item The order of a permutation is the least common multiple of the cycle lengths in its decomposition.
    \item $S_n$ is generated by the adjacent transpositions (the 2-cycles comprised of adjacent elements).
    The group can also be generated by $\left\{ (1 \; 2), \, (1 \; 2 \; \cdots \; n) \right\}$.
\end{itemize}
As a fun fact, $S_3$ can be used to create a permutation representation of $D_6$---if we label the vertices of a triangle with 1, 2, and 3, the movements of the vertices are represented by
\begin{align*}
    e' &\mapsto e & s &\mapsto (2 \; 3) \\
    r &\mapsto (1 \; 2 \; 3) & sr &\mapsto (1 \; 3) \\
    r^2 &\mapsto (1 \; 3 \; 2) & sr^2 &\mapsto (1 \; 2)
\end{align*}
Thus $S_3$ is isomorphic to $D_6$ ($S_3 \cong D_6$).

\begin{definition}[General linear group]
    For each $n \in \Z^+$ let $GL_n(F)$ be the set of all invertible $n \times n$ matrices whose entries come from a field $F$.
    $GL_n(F)$ is a group under matrix multiplication and is called the general linear group of degree $n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quaternion group]
    The quaternion group $Q_8$ has elements
    \[ Q_8 = \left\{ 1, -1, \, i, -i, \, j, -j, \, k, -k \right\}, \]
    where 1 is the identity.
    For any $a \in Q_8$, the elements multiply as follows.
    \begin{gather*}
        (-1)^2 = 1, \quad (-1) \cdot a = a \cdot (-1) = -a \\
        i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1 \\
        ij = k, \quad jk = i, \quad ki = j \\
        ji = -k, \quad kj = -i, \quad ik = -k
    \end{gather*}
\end{definition}

% we should also be familiar with cyclic groups at this point

% also! given two groups G and H, their cartesian product G x H is also a group with (a, b)(a', b') = (aa', bb').

\section{Homomorphisms}
Now we'll look at different kinds of maps between groups, starting with the simplest one posible.

\begin{definition}[Homomorphism]
    Let $G$ and $H$ be groups.
    A homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ is a function $\varphi : G \to H$ such that, for all $x,y \in G$,
    \[ \varphi(xy) = \varphi(x) \varphi(y). \]
    The kernel and image of $\varphi$ are, respectively,
    \[ \ker (\varphi) = \left\{ x \in G \; | \; \varphi(x) = 1 \right\}, \quad \pfn{image} (\varphi) = \left\{ \varphi(x) \; | \; x \in G \right\}. \]
\end{definition}

% in the homework we prove that ker(f) <= G and image(f) <= H.

\begin{theorem}[]
    Let $\varphi : G \to H$ be a homomorphism.
    Then
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item $\varphi(1)$ is the identity of $H$.
        \item $\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$.
        \item $\varphi(x^{n}) = \varphi(x)^{n}$ for all $x \in G$, $n \in \Z$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

If we want to do a better job at preserving structure in our map, we can go a step further.

\begin{definition}[Isomorphism]
    A homomorphism $\varphi : G \to H$ is an isomorphism if it is bijective.
    In this case we say $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, and we write $G \cong H$.
\end{definition}

The existence of the identity map on $G$ is enough to show that $G \cong G$, but other isomorphisms may exist.
For example, we may fix $g$ and define $\varphi_g : G \to G$ by setting $\varphi_g(x) = g x g^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$.
(This is a particular kind of isomorphism called an inner automorphism.)

\begin{definition}[Automorphism]
    An automorphism of a group $G$ is an isomorphism from G to $G$.
\end{definition}

Notably, the set $\pfn{Aut}(G)$ of automorphisms of $G$ forms a group under function composition!

\section{Group Actions}
We'll finish off our preliminary discussion of groups by looking at what might happen when a group acts on some other set.

\begin{definition}[Group action]
    A (left) group action of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a map from $G \times X$ to $X$, where the image of $(g,x)$ is written as $g \cdot x$ or simply $gx$, such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $g(hx) = (gh)x$ for all $g,h \in G$ and $x \in X$.
        \item $1x = x$ for all $x \in X$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

There are many easily accessible examples of group actions---here's the most glaring one.

\begin{definition}[Left regular action]
    Every group acts on itself by left multiplication.
    This is called the left regular action of $G$.
\end{definition}

As for some others: $\R^\times$ acts on $\R^n$ by scaling, $S_\Omega$ acts on $\Omega$ by permuting, and $D_{2n}$ acts on the vertices of a regular $n$-gon.

% Let $G = X$ and define $gx = g x g^{-1}$ for $g,x \in G$.

\begin{theorem}[]
    Suppose $G$ acts on $X$.
    For each $g \in G$, $\sigma_g(x) = g \cdot x$ defines a permutation of $X$.
    Moreover, the map from $G$ to $S_X$ defined by $g \mapsto \sigma_g$ is a homomorphism.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $g \in G$.
    Since $\sigma_g \circ \sigma_{g^{-1}}$ and $\sigma_{g^{-1}} \circ \sigma_g$ are both the identity map on $X$, $\sigma_g$ has a two-sided inverse and is therefore a bijection from $X$ to $X$.
    In other words, $\sigma_g$ is a permutation of $X$.     % cf. prop 1 in section 0.1

    Now define a map $\varphi : G \to S_X$ such that $\varphi(g) = \sigma_g$.
    We have
    \begin{align*}
        \varphi(gh) (x) &= \sigma_{gh}(x) \\
        &= (gh) \cdot x \\
        &= g \cdot (h \cdot x) \\
        &= \sigma_g (\sigma_h (x)) \\
        &= \left( \varphi(g) \circ \varphi(h) \right)(x)
    \end{align*}
    Since these two expressions agree as functions on $X$, they must be equal.
    This holds for all $g,h \in G$ and $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.
\end{proof}

% DEF. Suppose G acts on X and let (x in X). The orbit of x is
%       { gx | g in G }.

All this motivates the following.

\begin{definition}[Representation]
    Let $G$ be a group, and let $n \in \Z^+$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A homomorphism $\varphi : G \to S_n$ is called a permutation representation.
        \item A homomorphism $\rho : G \to GL_n(\C)$ is called a linear representation.
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{definition}
