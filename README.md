# undergrad-notes

This is an incomplete compilation of notes from all the mathematics and physics courses I've taken at Harvey Mudd College.

Here is a list of the courses that have been added so far, along with any relevant information about their status.
* ASTR062 Intro. to Astrophysics (SP24)
* MATH055 Discrete Mathematics (FA23)
* MATH073 Linear Algebra (SP23)
  * Missing proofs for all theorems
* MATH082 Differential Equations (SU23)
* MATH131 Mathematical Analysis I (SP24)
* PHYS023 Special Relativity (FA22)
* PHYS052 Quantum Physics (SP24)

The following courses run during the Fall 2024 semester, so they'll be incomplete for the forseeable future.
* MATH135 Complex Analysis (FA24)
* MATH157 Intermediate Probability (FA24)
* MATH171 Abstract Algebra I (FA24)
* MATH180 Intro. to Partial Differential Equations (FA24)
* PHYS111 Theoretical Mechanics (FA24)

These are some other courses I'd like to add in the future, in order of decreasing priority.
* PHYS051 Electromagnetic Theory and Optics (FA23)
* PHYS024 Mechanics and Wave Motion (SP23)
* MATH019 Single and Multivariable Calculus (FA22)
