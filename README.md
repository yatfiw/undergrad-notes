# undergrad-notes

This is an incomplete compilation of notes from all the mathematics and physics courses I've taken at Harvey Mudd College.

Here is a list of the courses that have been added so far, along with information about how close to completion they are.
* MATH055 Discrete Mathematics (FA23)
* MATH073 Linear Algebra (SP23)
  * Missing proofs for all theorems
* MATH082 Differential Equations (SU23)
* PHYS023 Special Relativity (FA22)
  * Missing all content

These are some other courses I'd like to add in the future, in order of decreasing priority.
* PHYS051 Electromagnetic Theory and Optics (FA23)
* PHYS024 Mechanics and Wave Motion (SP23)
* MATH019 Single and Multivariable Calculus (FA22)
