# undergrad-notes

This is an incomplete compilation of notes from all the mathematics and physics courses I've taken at Harvey Mudd College.

Here is a list of the courses that have been added so far, along with as-needed notes about how close to completion they are.
* MATH073 Linear Algebra (SP23)
  * Missing proofs for all theorems
* MATH082 Differential Equations, (SU23)
* MATH055 Discrete Mathematics, (FA23)
  * Missing Ch. 1 (Combinatorics)
  * Incomplete Ch. 3 (Graph Theory)
  * Missing proofs for some theorems

These are some other courses I'd like to add in the future, in order of decreasing priority.
* PHYS051 Electromagnetic Theory and Optics (FA23)
* PHYS023 Special Relativity (FA22)
* PHYS024 Mechanics and Wave Motion (SP23)
* MATH019 Single and Mulivariable Calculus (FA22)
