# undergrad-notes

This is a compilation of notes from all the math and physics courses I've taken at Harvey Mudd College.
Contents are below, excluding the intentionally incomplete notes.

The two courses in `unfinished` are there for different reasons.
* ASTR122 High-Energy Astrophysics (SP25).
The existing notes are incredibly messy and incomplete and I don't really want to deal with that.
* PHYS164 Particle Physics (SP25).
I dropped this one after a couple of weeks.

Also, I started work on this repo after already having finished the following courses.
Maybe I'll get around to them in the future.
* PHYS024 Mechanics and Wave Motion (SP23)
* MATH019 Single and Multivariable Calculus (FA22)
