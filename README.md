# undergrad-notes

This is an incomplete compilation of notes from all the mathematics and physics courses I've taken at Harvey Mudd College.

Here is a list of the courses that have been added so far, along with information about how close to completion they are.
* ASTR062 Intro. to Astrophysics (SP24)
* MATH055 Discrete Mathematics (FA23)
* MATH073 Linear Algebra (SP23)
  * Missing proofs for all theorems
* MATH082 Differential Equations (SU23)
* PHYS023 Special Relativity (FA22)
* PHYS052 Quantum Physics (SP24)

I'm currently taking the following courses, so they'll be incomplete until the end of April 2024 at the earliest.
* MATH131 Mathematical Analysis I (SP24)

These are some other courses I'd like to add in the future, in order of decreasing priority.
* PHYS051 Electromagnetic Theory and Optics (FA23)
* PHYS024 Mechanics and Wave Motion (SP23)
* MATH019 Single and Multivariable Calculus (FA22)
